## Hi there 👋, welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm Tim Beinert, a passionate software developer with engineering background from Germany. My journey began during my engineering studies, when I stepped into the world of simulation software development.
Since then, I've been focused on digitizing industrial engineering processes through custom-built software solutions.

What drives me? The ever-evolving nature of software development — it continuously pushes me to learn and grow.
While I’ll always value classical engineering, I might just be even more in love with building software. 😉

### 🔍 About me
Since 2017, I've been on a mission to optimize industrial engineering through custom software.
My background in numerics and engineering has consistently equipped me to tackle complex problems with structure, develop efficient algorithms, and contribute across disciplines — well beyond just writing code.
Along that way, I've deepened my knowledge in software engineering and development — always learning, always building.

Next to my professional projects in the industry, you’ll find my learning projects here, including engineering-focused software from my academic background.

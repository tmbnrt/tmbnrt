## Hi there 👋, welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm Tim Beinert, a passionate software developer and engineer from Germany. My journey began during my engineering studies, when I stepped into the development of simulation software.
Since then, I've been focused on digitizing industrial engineering processes through custom-built software solutions.

What drives me? The ever-evolving nature of software development — it constantly challenges me to learn and grow.
I still love building engineering structures, but I might just love building software even more. 😉

### 🔍 About me
Since 2017, I've been on a mission to optimize industrial engineering through custom software.
Along the way, I've deepened my knowledge in software engineering and development — always learning, always building.

Next to my professional projects in the industry, you’ll find my learning projects here, including engineering-focused software from my academic background.

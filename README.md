## Hi there 👋, welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm Tim Beinert, a passionate software systems engineer with simulation engineering background from Germany. My journey began during my engineering studies, when I stepped into the world of simulation software development.
Since then, I've been focused on digitizing engineering processes through custom-built software solutions.
Along the way, I’ve also grown a solid interest in data architecture — shaping clear data flows and practical structures that help complex engineering software stay understandable and easy to extend.

What drives me? The ever-evolving nature of software development — it continuously pushes me to learn and grow.
While I’ll always value classical engineering, I might even enjoy building software a little more. 😉

### 🔍 About me
My background in civil engineering and numerics has consistently equipped me to tackle complex problems with structure, develop efficient algorithms, and contribute across disciplines — well beyond just writing code. Over the years, I’ve worked extensively with FEM and GIS technologies, and I’m particularly interested in bringing both worlds together in future digital‑twin solutions.
